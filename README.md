# Movie Search App

Welcome in first version of Movie Search App.

The application is used to search for videos on imbd. 
It is built using the react and axios. To reduce ammount of 
calls we're caching data using react context API.



Below you will find more information and instruction how to run it

## First run

I assume you have node js, yarn and cloned repository installed

1. Go to catalog to the directory and type yarn in terminal
2. After installing node_modules, type yarn start in the terminal
3. Open browser and go to the [Movie Search App](http://localhost:3000)

## Achieved
1. Caching data with react context
2. Another Layer of abstraction dedicated to API
3. Controling app with url (we can share movie with other)
4. Error Page

## Further Plans

1. Add loader to avoid jumping effect
2. Increase text coverage
3. Hire UX designer
4. SSR to support SEO
5. Add rollbar to log events
6. Add tracker to check user actions
7. Integrate with orher API
8. Add filters to result page
